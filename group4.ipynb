    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to analyze sentiment in Tweets related to Apple and Google products. By classifying the sentiment of these Tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, the model will provide valuable insights into public perception, aiding businesses in marketing strategies and product development."

    "**Business Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era dominated by social media, brands must continuously track customer sentiments expressed online. Twitter, in particular, has become a critical platform where users voice their opinions about products and brands. However, the vast volume and rapid pace of tweets make it impractical for businesses to manually analyze these opinions for insights. To address this, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model needs to be developed to automatically classify the sentiment of tweets and determine which brand or product is the target of those sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset from CrowdFlower includes over 9,000 tweets that have been evaluated for sentiment (positive, negative, or no emotion) and tagged with the associated brand or product. The goal is to build an NLP model that can accurately and efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classify Sentiments**: Identify whether a tweet expresses positive, negative, or no emotion.\n",
    "2. **Identify Brand/Product**: Recognize which brand or product is being referred to in the tweet.\n",
    "3. **Handle Ambiguity**: Deal with tweets that might reference multiple brands or unclear sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Textual Variations**: Dealing with informal language, abbreviations, emojis, and slang used on social media.\n",
    "- **Context Understanding**: Ensuring the model understands subtle and implicit expressions of sentiment.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Processing**: Building a scalable solution that can process large volumes of data in real time for timely insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this problem will help brands enhance their reputation management, respond promptly to consumer feedback, and optimize their marketing strategies based on real-time sentiment analysis."

    "#### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Binary Classification Model:** The first objective is to develop a binary classification model to classify tweets as either positive or negative. Using Logistic Regression, this model aims to achieve a benchmark accuracy of 85%, serving as a proof of concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Multiclass Classification Expansion:** After establishing a successful binary classification, we will develop a multiclass classifier to include neutral sentiments. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of consumer sentiment and will be built using models like XGBoost and Multinomial Naive Bayes, with a target accuracy of 70%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Sentiment Comparison Between Apple and Google Products:** A final objective is to compare sentiment across the brands by analyzing the distribution of sentiments in tweets mentioning Apple, Google, and other products. This comparison will provide valuable insights for stakeholders to refine their strategies."

    "\n",
    "**1. Product Managers** at Apple and Google, who can use the insights to tweak product features based on consumer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Marketing Teams** looking to assess the effectiveness of campaigns or brand perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Customer Support Teams**, who can use the analysis to proactively address negative sentiment or capitalize on positive feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Consultants and market analysts** seeking to provide data-driven advice to tech companies on consumer perceptions."

    "##### Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Data Understanding**\n",
    "   - Familiarizing with the structure of the dataset (e.g., columns like `tweet_text`, `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at`, and `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product`).\n",
    "   - Identifying any initial anomalies (e.g., missing values, duplicates) that need cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Data Preparation**\n",
    "- Preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Removed duplicate entries.\n",
    "    - Addressed missing values by populating the emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at column with \"none\" and removed entries     lacking tweet_text.\n",
    "    - Applied text preprocessing techniques: tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Modeling**\n",
    "    - Utilized key libraries: NLTK (for tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization), sklearn's CountVectorizer (for vectorization), and pandas (for data handling).\n",
    "    - Developed a logistic regression model for binary classification (positive/negative sentiment), aiming for 70% accuracy.\n",
    "    - Expanded to a multiclass classifier to include neutral sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.**Evaluation**\n",
    "    - Accuracy was used as the main evaluation metric, measuring the model's overall ability to classify sentiments correctly.\n",
    "    - While the model performed satisfactorily, missing values and data quality issues are potential limitations."
